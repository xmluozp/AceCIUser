How do I user the Ace CI User with my current project?

require those new files:

	/application/Helpers/ - 
		User_email_helper.php
		User_utilities_helper.php
		User_variables_helper.php
		
	/application/Models/ -
		organizations_model.php
		users_model.php
		user_groups_model.php
		
	/application/Controllers/ -
		Organizations.php
		Users.php
		
	/application/Hooks -
		UserAuth.php	
		
	/application/Views/users/ -
		All
		
	/Assets/
		All, css, js, pictures and so on
		
	/uploads/
		Create this folder for upload logos of organization()
			error.png
			logo.png
	
	/Vendor/
		Copy all, or...
			Install Mailgun	
			(if its covering to a existing project, need to:)
			need a composer installed
			open cmd, redirect to project root(the "index.php" directory)
			run command:
				composer require mailgun/mailgun-php php-http/guzzle6-adapter php-http/message
	
----------------------------
Make Mailgun work
	See mailgun website
	Set your mail service key
		Helpers/User_email_helper.php	
----------------------------
Then we need configurations to make it work:

	Config/config.php
		Change to your base url
			$config['base_url'] = 'http://localhost:31337/AceCIUser';
		Turn on hooks
			$config['enable_hooks'] = TRUE;
		Some autoloads have to be there
			session, cookie, database
		
	Config/hooks.php
		Copy the content of hooks.php file to your project

	Config/constants.php
		Copy all settings in "----Ace CI User----"
		
	Config/database.php
		Database has to be set, for example:
			'hostname' => 'localhost:3306',
			'username' => 'johnuser',
			'password' => '123',
			'database' => 'aceciuser'

    Helpers/User_variables_helper.php
        Here to set your project functions to work with role system
        The first function, variables_get_auth(), has to be set. Its a list of permissions. Anyone without permission will be kicked out.
        There are 4 arguments.
            1: The role level, not id
            2: The Controller name needs to be checked
            3: The Function name to be checked, * is wildcard means all functions in this controller. The wildcard checking has lower priority.
            4: Operator, could be =, >, <, >=, <=
        For example, $returnValue[] = array(VISITOR, "Users","*", ">=");
            Means anyone want to run any function in Users, has to be a VISITOR or higher(VISITOR here is 0 level, means everyone)
	
----------------------------
Then generate database and go

	Run PHP
			
	Open the page /aceciuser_setting.php
		Hit the button, generate the tables
		
	Open the page index.php/users/view_login.php
		You can set it as the first page of your app.
		For example, edit your config/routes.php
		$route['default_controller'] = 'users/view_login';

		
----------------------------	
For additional

    About Captcha
        The constant LOGIN_ATTEMPTING_LIMIT is the login try times before the Captcha occurred. Right now is 2 just for testing purpose.
        Please at least set it to 5.
        There are some other picture generate settings in Captcha.php

    You can customize your navigation bar for different user groups. (if you don't have your own navigation bar)
        It's in
            Helpers/User_variables_helper.php
                variables_get_navigation()
                    Set the full navigation bar
                variables_get_navigation_permissions()
                    Set the different user group's navigation bar
                
    You can set what should be put in the email notification
        It's in
            Helpers/User_variables_helper.php
                variables_emails()
                
    If you want additional columns for a user, and you want to keep the User Management page rather than use your own, then you need to modify MVC:
        M:
            Models/Users_model.php
                read_datatable()
                    Change what columns should be read for the user list
                    the extra search part will process the Advanced Search request from User List page
					
		V:
			View/users/page_index.php
				Find the <table> tag with id="list_users", add what column you want, have to match the column name from the Model. If its not matching, that <td> fileds will be blank.
				
				Those attributes start with "data-" are the annotation of columns, if you want to use the Datatables in your project, feel free to do so.
					*  data-source: --- name of the column you are looking for
					*  data-orderby-desc
					*  data-orderby-asc: --- if has this attribute, will be as default sorting
					*  data-filter: --- what columns will be respond by the filter
					*  data-icon: ---   if its an icon column. (the value=>icon settings are in create_datatable.js)
					*  data-class: ---  change the column's classname
					*  data-render: --- change content, need a render function code below. The render function arguments have to be like: fn(data, type, row, meta). The return value will be filled into the <td> tag
					*  data-multiselect: --- set the column as multi checkbox column
			View/users/form_modal_user.php
				The divs userDetailModal and userCreateModal are the form of create or edit an user by the administrator.
				If you add any item, please keep the attribute "data-validation", otherwise this item will not be submitted when you hit "save" button.
				Those attributes start with "data-" are annotations.
					*  data-not-retrive : will be keep empty when getting data
					*  data-validation : will be validated when submitting data
					*  data-render : Instead of fill-in, the system will call a function. The function format have to be like: fn(itemSelector, value)
					
		C:		
			Controllers/Users.php
				form_signup()
					What information will be stored when user signup
				ajax_create()
					What information will be stored when the administrator create an user
				ajax_update()
					Columns of admin-update an user
				
			Becareful, In order to prevent anonymous requests, functions here are better been set (in the permission list). 

	If you need more user groups (roles), you need to change 3 places:
		Database
			insert a record to user_groups
			change your admin account's user groups(if you changed the group id of admin user)
		Config/constants.php
						
		Helpers/User_variables_helper.php
			Give the new role a customized navigation bar
		
		---- but do not delete the Visitor group, it will be used for the "level = 0" situation.
		
	Default admin is: 
		admin@rrc.none
