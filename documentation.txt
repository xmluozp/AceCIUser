How do I user the Ace CI User with my project?

require those new files:

	Helpers/ - 
		User_email_helper.php
		User_utilities_helper.php
		User_variables_helper.php
		
	Models/
		organizations_model.php
		users_model.php
		user_groups_model.php
		
	Controllers/
		Organizations.php
		Users.php
		
	Hooks
		UserAuth.php	
		
	Views/users/
		All
		
	/Assets
		All, css, js, pictures and so on
		
	/uploads
		Create this folder for upload logos of organization()
			error.png
			logo.png
	
	/vendor
		All, or...
			Install Mailgun	
			(if its covering to a existing project, need to:)
			need a composer installed
			open cmd, redirect to project root(the "index.php" directory)
			run command:
				composer require mailgun/mailgun-php php-http/guzzle6-adapter php-http/message
	
----------------------------
Make Mailgun work
	See mailgun website
	Set your mail service key
		Helpers/User_email_helper.php	
----------------------------
Then we need configurations to make it work:

	Config/config.php
		Change to your base url
			$config['base_url'] = 'http://localhost:31337/AceCIUser';
		Turn on hooks
			$config['enable_hooks'] = TRUE;
		Some autoloads have to be there
			session, cookie, database
		
	Config/hooks.php
		Copy the content of hooks.php file to your project

	Config/constants.php
		Copy all settings in "----Ace CI User----"
		
	Config/database.php
		Database has to be set, for example:
			'hostname' => 'localhost:3306',
			'username' => 'johnuser',
			'password' => '123',
			'database' => 'aceciuser'

	Helpers/User_variables_helper.php
		Here to set your project functions work with role system
		The first function, variables_get_auth(), has to be set. Its a list of permissions. Anyone without permission will be kicked out.
		There are 4 arguments.
			1: The role level, not id
			2: The Controller name needs to be checked
			3: The Function name to be checked, * is wildcard means all functions in this controller. The wildcard checking has lower priority.
			4: Operator, could be =, >, <, >=, <=
		For example, $returnValue[] = array(VISITOR, "Users","*", ">=");
			Means any one want to run any function in Users, has to be a VISITOR or higher(VISITOR here is 0 level, means everyone)
	
----------------------------
Then generate database and go

	Run PHP
			
	Open the page /aceciuser_setting.php
		Hit the button, generate the tables
		
	Open the page index.php/users/view_login.php
		You can set it as the first page of your app.
		For example, edit your config/routes.php
		$route['default_controller'] = 'users/view_login';



		
----------------------------	
	For additional, you can customize your navigation bar for different user groups
