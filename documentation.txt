Helpers - 
	User_email_helper.php
	User_utilities_helper.php
	User_variables_helper.php
	
Models

	users_model.php
	user_groups_model.php
	
Hooks

Libraries

Install Mailgun
	(if its covering to a existing project, need to:)
	need a composer installed
	open cmd, redirect to project root(the "index.php" directory)
	run command:
		composer require mailgun/mailgun-php php-http/guzzle6-adapter php-http/message

Make Mailgun work
	see mailgun website
	Set your mail service key
		Helpers/User_email_helper.php	
----------------------------
Then we need configurations to make it work:

Config/config.php
	change to your base url
		$config['base_url'] = 'http://localhost:31337/AceCIUser';
	turn on hooks
		$config['enable_hooks'] = TRUE;
	some autoloads have to be there
		session, cookie, database
	
Config/hooks.php
	copy the content of hooks.php file to your project

Config/constants.php
	copy all settings in "----Ace CI User----"
	
Config/database.php
	database has to be set, for example:
		'hostname' => 'localhost:3306',
		'username' => 'johnuser',
		'password' => '123',
		'database' => 'aceciuser'

Helpers/User_variables_helper.php
	Here to set your project functions work with role system
	The first function, variables_get_auth(), has to be set. Its a list of permissions. Anyone without permission will be kicked out.
	There are 4 arguments.
		1: the role level, not id
		2: the Controller name needs to be checked
		3: the Function name to be checked, * is wildcard means all functions in this controller. The wildcard checking has lower priority.
		4: operator, could be =, >, <, >=, <=
	For example, $returnValue[] = array(VISITOR, "Users","*", ">=");
		means any one want to run any function in Users, has to be a VISITOR or higher(VISITOR here is 0 level, means everyone)
	
	
----------------------------
Run PHP
		
Open /aceciuser_setting.php
	hit the button, generate the tables
	
Open index.php/users/view_login.php
	Its the first page of a web-app: login page. redirect your home to here!
	For example, modify your config/routes.php
	$route['default_controller'] = 'users/view_login';
